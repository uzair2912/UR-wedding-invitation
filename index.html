                    <p>
                        Like most of the Indian wedding story, our story is also the same. 
                        Yes! our marriage is an arranged marriage. The boy and girl look at
                        each other, liked each other, and decide to spend their whole life together.
                        Sounds weird, and frankly speaking, initially, we were also not sure that 
                        how we will be together.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>
                        But as we have all heard the saying: 
                        "Couples are made in heaven, and destiny will bring the right one for you". 
                        It's true.I did not believe it until I met her.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>
                        After we decide to marry, we start talking and realize that this
                        is the one, who is made for me. It's amazing seeing how comfortable we are together,
                        how we have some unsaying trust and understanding for each other, 
                        how we start taking care for the wishes and choices of other, and how we
                        feel in deep love.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>
                        Its been just some months, but it seems like we knew each other  
                        from the years. These whole things make me believe in my destiny and now I can
                        definitely say that she is the one who is made for me and we were meant to be together
                        and forever.
                    </p><br>
